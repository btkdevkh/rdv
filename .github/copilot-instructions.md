## ✅ Code Quality Rules

- Follow the standard conventions of the language and framework in use
- Prefer readability over premature optimization
- Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and files
- No “magic”: explain the intent behind complex logic
- Always include proper error handling
- Avoid code duplication → extract reusable functions or components
- Keep folder structure consistent and logical
- Add comments only when they clarify **why**, not what the code does

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- Never silently ignore errors
- Provide helpful and contextual error messages
- Only expose safe and necessary information to end-users
